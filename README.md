## Help

Hello everyone, this is my first experience with Nuxt and app development in general. I have created a simple authentication app using Nuxt Auth Utils (hopefully correctly), saving user registration data in MongoDB and storing the user's Email and ID in the User store using Pinia. Given that this is my first approach to web programming and Nuxt in general, I would like to ask if there are any errors and if the code seems like a good starting template. I aim to make the code as robust and correct as possible, so I would appreciate advice on what to modify in the most correct and efficient way.
